<h1><b>Chain of Events</b></h1>

<p>A boy exits a shed smoking a cigarette.  The door of the shed knocks a bucket over.  The bucket rolls down the hill to the river bank.  The bucket knocks an oar off a small boat.  The boy sees the oar fall into the river and runs toward it.  He drops his cigarette in the rush.  The cigarette lands on the rope tying the boat to the riverbank.  The rope lights on fire.  The boy jumps into the boat to try and grab the oar.  The weight of his body pushes the boat away from shore.  The wake of the boat sends the oar out of the boy's reach.  The boy drifts further down river in the boat.  The boat gets caught in some rapids.  The rapids send the boy in his boat down a treacherous path.  The rocks in the river tear a hole in the boat.  The boat sinks.  The boy is swept up in the riverâ€™s current.  The river pushes him towards a small island.  The boy escapes the river into the wilds. </p>
